# D3-Challenge

This repo contains an interactive scatter plot with 3 choices on both the x and y axes. 
The data is from the 2014 census. 
When a label is selected from the axes, the plot should:
1. Update the scale of the axis
2. Transition the circles
3. Update the text in the circles
4. Update the tooltip when hovered
